# Credit Risk Analysis

## Purpose

The task was to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn to evaluate the use of machine learning models to resample data and provide feedback.
A credit card credit dataset from the LendingClub organization, a peer-to-peer lending services company, will be processed through these 6 different models. The results and accuracy scores will be compared along with pictures.

## Results
Here will be a list of different models and their scores:

  *Accuracy = Acc*

  *Precision = Pre*

  *Recall = Rec*



### Random Oversampler

Accuracu: %62.99

Precision: 0 = 0.01 /n
           1 = 1.00

Recall: 0 = 0.66
        1 = 0.60
