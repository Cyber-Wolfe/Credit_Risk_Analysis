# Credit Risk Analysis

## Purpose

The task was to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn to evaluate the use of machine learning models to resample data and provide feedback.
A credit card credit dataset from the LendingClub organization, a peer-to-peer lending services company, will be processed through these 6 different models. The results and accuracy scores will be compared along with pictures.

## Results
Here will be a list of different models and their scores: 
  *Accuracy = Acc*
  *Precision = Pre*
  *Recall = Rec*
